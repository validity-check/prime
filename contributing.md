First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! I am sure it will be better with your help.

## You need...
NodeJS installed with NPM

## To Contribute...
First, you need to create a fork. Clone the fork and run `npm install` inside its folder.

I recommend creating a new branch with a descriptive yet short name about what you changes you intend to make. Make your changes and remember to make frequent, descriptive commits.

Once you are done, create a PR describing your changes. I will attend to it when I have time.

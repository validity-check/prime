# Prime

A program using inquirer.js which finds all prime numbers between two given numbers.

## Use Prime

### Prerequisites

To clone this you only need NodeJS (which ships NPM with it).

It hasn't quite been packaged for use without Node yet, so to use it you still need Node installed.

### Clone

To clone, click the clone button at www.github.com/validity-check/prime.

Then, open a command prompt in the folder where you have cloned the repo.

Run `npm start` and type in the required responses for it to generate the report of the prime numbers in the numbers you specified.
